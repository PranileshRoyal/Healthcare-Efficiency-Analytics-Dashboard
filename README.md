# Healthcare-Efficiency-Analytics-Dashboard
A comprehensive Power BI solution analyzing hospital efficiency metrics for elective hip replacement surgeries across New York State, delivering actionable insights for healthcare optimization.
üìã Project Overview
This project represents a complete healthcare analytics solution built for HealthStat, a fictional healthcare consulting organization. The dashboard analyzes patient-level data from hospitals across New York State, focusing on elective hip replacement surgeries to identify efficiency patterns, cost drivers, and performance outliers.
üéØ Business Problems Solved
Primary Healthcare Challenges Addressed:
1. Hospital Performance Benchmarking

Identified significant variations in Length of Stay (LOS) across 200+ hospitals
Established state-wide benchmarks for cost and efficiency metrics
Created comparative analysis framework for hospital performance evaluation

2. Cost Optimization & Resource Allocation

Analyzed average cost per discharge variations ranging from $8,000 to $25,000+ across facilities
Identified cost drivers through statistical analysis of patient demographics, severity, and hospital characteristics
Provided data-driven insights for resource allocation and budget planning

3. Quality of Care Assessment

Correlated patient outcomes with hospital characteristics and surgical program sizes
Analyzed mortality risk and severity of illness impact on treatment costs
Enabled evidence-based decisions for patient referral and care pathways

4. Operational Efficiency Enhancement

Created dynamic quadrant analysis to identify high-cost, high-LOS outlier hospitals
Developed surgical program size classifications to understand volume-outcome relationships
Provided root cause analysis tools for operational improvement initiatives

üîß Technical Implementation
Data Architecture & Modeling
dax// Key DAX Measures Implemented
Total Hospitals = DISTINCTCOUNT(facility_id)
Total Discharges = COUNTROWS(hospital_discharges)
Average LOS Days = AVERAGE(length_of_stay)
Total Surgeons = DISTINCTCOUNT(operating_provider_license_number)

Average Cost per Discharge = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(hospital_discharges[total_costs]),
    [Total Discharges]
)

% Var Average Cost per Discharge = 
DIVIDE(
    ([Average Cost per Discharge]-[Average Cost per Discharge ALL]),
    [Average Cost per Discharge ALL]
)
